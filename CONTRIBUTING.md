## Contribute

This repository is meant for development within the RUB EP1 group, so you're welcome to fork and submit pull/merge requests! Alternatively, you can [request access](https://jollyj.ep1.rub.de/redeboer1/pyPawianTools/-/project_members/request_access).

### Conventions
* Please use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): start the commit with a semantic keyword (see e.g. [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type) or [these examples](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages), followed by [a column](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers), then the message. The message itself should be in imperative moodâ€”just imagine the commit to give a command to the code framework. So for instance: `feat: add coverage report tools` or `fix: remove `.
* In the master branch, each commit should compile and be tested. In your own branches, it is recommended to commit frequently (WIP keyword), but squash those commits upon submitting a merge request.
* Try to keep test coverage high. You can test current coverage by running
  ```
  pytest --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov=./ --cov-report html
  ```
  from the main directory and opening the resulting file `htmlcov/index.html`.
